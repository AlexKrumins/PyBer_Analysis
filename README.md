# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project is to gather, import, analyze and finally visualize, all of the rideshare data for the fictional ride-share company, PyBer, by working with two large data files containing information regarding individual rides, cities, and drivers.

## Results
We started by grouping the data by types of cities: Rural, Suburban and Urban. We then found the total fares and average fares for each city type. The resulting data was used to create the following PyBer Summary data frame.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47199557/182746308-67b81603-948f-4387-b392-9be4fdacc3dd.png)

Next we used groupbu() to create a data fram summarizing fares by date and city type. Using a pivot table, we gathered the data for Jan 2019 - Apr 2019  and categorized by each week, resulting in the following data. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47199557/182746429-8437472f-9702-4773-853d-9411933b41bf.png)

Then a visualization was created showing the trends of each city type's total fare.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47199557/182746587-797ef7ae-98ba-4247-b7cc-9034cfb654dd.png)

Summary:
Based on the overall analysis of the ride and city data a number of disparities are seen. The largest of which is the rural metrics. Every metric measured in the analysis of the city types has rural cities only pulling in a portion of the market share.
